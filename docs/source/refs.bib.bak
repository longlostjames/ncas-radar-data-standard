  abstract  = {{During the night of 26–27 May 2017, a mesoscale convective system (MCS) rapidly developed over Cornwall and Devon in the South West of England, producing about 3500 lightning flashes in 3 h and 23 sprites. The MCS-type storm was characterised by a circular shape with a size of about 52,000 km2 (cloud top temperature lower than - 40 °C) and a local minimum in the CG flash rate (\textbackslashtextasciitilde15 min−1), when most of the sprites were observed. The mean intensity of the sprite parent CG strokes was exceptionally high in this case (+170 kA), while the associated charge moment changes ranged from 600 to 2000C km. Two identical detectors, located at different sites in southern England, measured the quasi-static displacement currents induced on metallic electrodes when exposed to the changing atmospheric electric field produced by the storm's discharges. A series of coincident large amplitude short-peak transients, some of which associated with the sprite-producing strokes, were recorded on these detectors. A multi-instrumental analysis of the lightning events producing transient current “spikes” on the electrodes revealed a significant bias towards large peak currents exceeding 100 kA, but only a minor dependence on the impulse charge moment change (iCMC) for those associated with the sprites. We suggest that the current spikes may be induced by a coupling with the electromagnetic impulse radiated by intense lightning discharges. The ease in discriminating such signatures makes the method suitable for monitoring the occurrence of powerful lightning, potentially associated with night-time transient luminous events (TLEs), thereby avoiding the limitations inherent to optical observations and radio noise affecting other receivers.}},

abstract = {{Abstract Observations of the precipitation rate/depth, drop-size distribution, drop-velocity distribution and precipitation type are compared from six in-situ precipitation sensor designs over 12 months to assess their performance and provide a benchmark for future design and deployment. The designs considered are: tipping-bucket (TBR), drop-counting (RAL), acoustic (JWD), optical (LPM), single-angle visiometer with capacitor (PWD21) and dual-angle visiometer (PWS100). Precipitation rates are compared for multiple time resolutions over the study period, while drop size and velocity distributions are compared with cases at stable precipitation rates. To examine precipitation type a new index and a logic algorithm to amalgamate consecutive precipitation type observations consistently is introduced and applied. Overall the choice of instrument for deployment depends on the usage. For fast response (less than 15 minutes), the PWD21 and TBR should not be used. As precipitation rate or the duration of a sample increases, the correlation of the TBR with the majority of other instruments increases. However, the PWD21 consistently underestimates precipitation. The RAL,PWS100 andJWDare within ± 15\% for precipitation depth over 12 months. All instruments are inconsistent in their ability to observe drop size and velocity distributions for differing precipitation rates. There is low agreement between the instruments for precipitation type estimation. The PWD21 and PWS100 rarely report some precipitation types, but the LPM reports more broadly. Meteorological stations should use several instrument designs for redundancy and to more accurately capture precipitation characteristics.}},

abstract = {{Operational forecasting centres increasingly rely on convection‐permitting NWP simulations to assist in their forecasting of convective events. The evaluation of upgrades in the underlying NWP modelling system normally happens through routine verification using traditional metrics on two‐dimensional fields, such as gridded rainfall data. Object‐ and process‐based evaluation can identify specific physical mechanisms for model improvement, but such evaluation procedures normally require targeted and expensive field campaigns. Here, we explore the potential use of the UK operational radar network observations and its derived 3D composite product for evaluating the representation of convective storms in the Met Office Unified Model. A comparison of the 1 × 1 × 0.5 km 3D radar composites against observations made with the research‐grade radar at Chilbolton in the southern UK indicates that the 3D radar composite data can reliably be used to evaluate the morphology of convective storms. The 3D radar composite data are subsequently used to evaluate the development of convective storms in the Met Office Unified Model. Such analysis was previously unavailable due to a lack of 3D radar data of high temporal frequency. The operational nature of the UK radar data makes these 3D composites a valuable resource for future studies of the initiation, growth, development, and organisation of convective storms over the UK. Operational radar networks can be used to study the characteristics of convective storms, including their 3D morphology and development throughout the day. Two 3D composite radar products are verified against high‐resolution radar observations and are found to be reliable for analysis of storm structures using low reflectivity thresholds, but not for high thresholds associated with small‐scale features such as convective cores. The 3D composite data (Radar) shed new light on the development of convective storms in convection‐permitting NWP models (Model).}},

The study uses 1 million variants of the Hadley Centre General Environment Model version 3 (HadGEM3) that sample 26 sources of uncertainty, together with over 9000 monthly aggregated grid-box measurements of aerosol optical depth, PM2.5, particle number concentrations, sulfate and organic mass concentrations. Despite many compensating effects in the model, the procedure constrains the probability distributions of parameters related to secondary organic aerosol, anthropogenic SO2 emissions, residential emissions, sea spray emissions, dry deposition rates of SO2 and aerosols, new particle formation, cloud droplet pH and the diameter of primary combustion particles. Observational constraint rules out nearly 98 \% of the model variants. On constraint, the ±1σ (standard deviation) range of global annual mean direct radiative forcing (RFari) is reduced by 33 \% to -0.14 to -0.26 Wm-2, and the 95 \% credible interval (CI) is reduced by 34 \% to -0.1 to -0.32 Wm-2. For the global annual mean aerosol–cloud radiative forcing, RFaci, the ±1σ range is reduced by 7 \% to -1.66 to -2.48 Wm-2, and the 95 \% CI by 6 \% to -1.28 to -2.88 Wm-2. The tightness of the constraint is limited by parameter cancellation effects (model equifinality) as well as the large and poorly defined “representativeness error” associated with comparing point measurements with a global model. The constraint could also be narrowed if model structural errors that prevent simultaneous agreement with different measurement types in multiple locations and seasons could be improved. For example, constraints using either sulfate or PM2.5 measurements individually result in RFari±1σ ranges that only just overlap, which shows that emergent constraints based on one measurement type may be overconfident.}},

Now proposals are being made to operate such systems in Q/V band (33 - 75 GHz) which experience a wider range of rain fade levels. Due to the higher rate of change in fade levels, a major aspect of the ACM design is how to set margins accurately in order to avoid frame losses at the next operation point when the link state is not yet perfectly known. Existing techniques have focused on using predetermined margins but this approach results in poor performance when the actual rain fade profile is different from the pattern assumed. In order to improve performance, we propose the use of adaptive margins derived dynamically during the actual rain event. Simulation results show a robust performance in spectral efficiency at a low frame error rate (FER) in comparison with the existing techniques.}},

abstract = {{Reducing man‐made greenhouse gas emissions depends on the effective detection and location of sources. We present a new method that remotely detects, locates, and quantifies gas emission rates by sequentially steering an optical beam between multiple retro‐reflectors. The novel open‐path laser gas sensor uses Laser Dispersion Spectroscopy (LDS), with seven beams up to 98 meters long deployed across open, flat terrain. LDS offers high precision (10–20 ppb), high dynamic range and linearity, enhanced immunity to atmospheric perturbations, with fast response to probe an area in 3 s. Simultaneous wind and concentration data were collected for four calibrated methane gas release schemes with emission rates of \textbackslashtextasciitilde1.3 kg/hr. The resulting data were processed using a Bayesian, Markov chain Monte‐Carlo inverse solver to locate the sources and quantify their mass emission rates and uncertainty bounds. All the sources were located to within a few meters and mass emission rates established within the associated confidence bounds. The Earth's atmosphere contains 600 times as much CO2 as methane (by mass), but the warming effect due to the small amount of methane is 58\% of that due to all the CO2. Furthermore, methane's atmospheric lifetime is \textbackslashtextasciitilde10 yr whereas CO2's is \textbackslashtextasciitilde100 yr. So, reducing methane emissions not only provides much greater impact per unit mass but that reduction in atmospheric warming is realized in years not centuries. Many industrial activities produce methane emissions, but difficulties in remotely attributing and quantifying emission rates have severely impeded effective remedial action. We present a novel method to continuously detect, locate, and quantify methane emission sources distributed across extensive areas. We demonstrate its performance in simple controlled tests using a novel optical beam gas sensor to measure path‐averaged gas concentrations. The data are analyzed using advanced statistical methods to locate and quantify the emission rates of the sources. Seventeen calibrated methane releases of \textbackslashtextasciitilde1.3 kg/hr per source in four release schemes of single and dual sources distributed across a 120 × 120 m2 area Tunable laser dispersion spectrometer operating at 3.3 μm is used in seven open paths, with sequential scanning of the full beam array in 3 s Sources located to few meters accuracy and emission rates quantified with 0.1 to 0.5 kg/hr uncertainty, including sources outside the beam array}},

The heights of the boundary layer (BL) varied from as low as \textbackslashtextasciitilde1100 m to \textbackslashtextasciitilde2600 km and BL height had shown to have evolved from 0700 universal time (UT) onwards and collapsed by 0000 UT.  Besides, a comparison made between winds measured by the 1290 MHz radar and near-by radiosonde showed a moderate similitude between them, albeit a few discrepancies are found in wind directions and speeds. The possible reasons for these discrepancies could be different volume sensing of observations of these independent observations. An attempt is, therefore, made to calculate radiosonde balloon drifts [1] for the ascending node of the balloons, which had confirmed that the balloons often drifted horizontally as long as up to 100 km. The large drifts, most probably, are the possible reasons for the mismatching of winds measured by these two independent remote sensing instruments.}},

In this new technique, the hydrometeor types are identified as clusters belonging to a hierarchical structure. The number of different hydrometeor types in the data is not predefined, and the method obtains the optimal number of clusters through a recursive process. The optimal clustering is then used to label the original data. Initial results using observations from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) X-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar (NXPol) show that the technique provides stable and consistent results. Comparison with available airborne in situ measurements also indicates the value of this novel method for providing a physical delineation of radar observations. Although this demonstration uses NXPol data, the technique is generally applicable to similar multivariate data from other radar observations.}},

abstract = {{Satellite nowcasting potentially provides a vital opportunity to mitigate against the risks of severe weather in tropical Africa, where population growth and climate change are exposing an ever growing number of people to weather hazards. Numerical weather prediction demonstrates limited skill for much of Africa and weather radars are rare. However, geostationary satellites provide excellent spatial and temporal coverage of the often long‐lasting convective storms that deliver heavy rain, lightning and strong winds, presenting a valuable opportunity for satellite nowcasting. Here, we evaluate the skill of satellite nowcasting products for tropical Africa: these products are routinely generated, but to our best knowledge never routinely used in tropical Africa before the Global Challenges Research Fund African SWIFT (Science for Weather Information and Forecasting Techniques) project. Focusing in particular on convective rainfall rate (CRR) and rapidly developing thunderstorm convection warning (RDT‐CW) products, we demonstrate that both are useful nowcasting tools. The CRR product produces very different rainfall climatologies for day and night in tropical Africa. This is associated with greater skill of the product during daytime, particularly for heavier rain rates. The RDT‐CW product is able to identify around 60\% of heavy (>5 mm·hr−1) rainfall events with the fraction detected increasing with increasing rainfall rate. For both products, extrapolation forwards in time (up to 90 and 60 min, respectively) maintains useful skill in tropical Africa, motivating work to develop longer lead‐time nowcasts. We conclude that widespread uptake of satellite nowcasting could provide new skilful weather predictions on short time‐scales in much of tropical Africa. The weather in tropical Africa has a huge impact on the local population; severe storms often lead to destruction of property and even loss of life. Consequently, improved nowcasting capabilities could bring huge benefits both to the livelihoods of the local populations and to regional economies. In the present study we demonstrate that satellite‐based nowcasting products initially developed for Europe can provide skilful predictions for tropical Africa.}},

Based on this, it studies the performance of SGD in terms of feeder availability and number of switches between GWs taking into account the climatic region, the switching processing delay, the clustering of GWs, and the impact of downlink versus uplink frequency in Q/V band.

We used a filtration system on the UK Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) research aircraft to sample a range of primary biological aerosols across southern England overflying surface measurement sites from Chilbolton to Weybourne. We identified 30 to 60 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 108 to 224 eukaryotic OTUs per sample. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified significant numbers of genera that have not been found in atmospheric samples previously or only been described in limited number of atmospheric field studies, which are rather old or published in local journals. This includes the genera Gordonia, Lautropia, and Psychroglaciecola. Some of the bacterial genera found in this study include potential human pathogens, for example, Gordonia, Sphingomonas, Chryseobacterium, Morganella, Fusobacterium, and Streptococcus. 18S rRNA gene sequencing showed Cladosporium to be the major genus in all of the samples, which is a well-known allergen and often found in the atmosphere. There were also genetic signatures of potentially allergenic taxa; for example, Pleosporales, Phoma, and Brassicales. Although there was no significant clustering of bacterial and eukaryotic communities depending on the sampling location, we found meteorological factors explaining significant variations in the community composition.

They frequently elect to fly on winds with directions quite different from the prevailing direction, and they show a degree of common orientation, both of which facilitate transport in seasonally beneficial directions. Much less is known about the migration behaviour of smaller (10–70 mg) insects. To address this issue, we used radar to examine the high-altitude flight of hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), a group of day-active, medium-sized insects commonly migrating over the UK. We found that autumn migrants, which must move south, did indeed show migration timings and orientation responses that would take them in this direction, despite the unfavourability of the prevailing winds. Evidently, these hoverfly migrants must have a compass (probably a time-compensated solar mechanism), and a means of sensing the wind direction (which may be determined with sufficient accuracy at ground level, before take-off). By contrast, hoverflies arriving in the UK in spring showed weaker orientation tendencies, and did not correct for wind drift away from their seasonally adaptive direction (northwards). However, the spring migrants necessarily come from the south (on warm southerly winds), so we surmise that complex orientation behaviour may not be so crucial for the spring movements.}},

Starting in February 2017, a network of 14 Thies laser precipitation monitors (LPMs) were installed at various locations around the United Kingdom to create the Disdrometer Verification Network (DiVeN). The instruments were installed for verification of radar hydrometeor classification algorithms but are valuable for much wider use in the scientific and operational meteorological community. Every Thies LPM is able to designate each observed hydrometeor into one of 20 diameter bins from ≥0.125 to >8 mm and one of 22 speed bins from >0.0 to >20.0 m s−1. Using empirically derived relationships, the instrument classifies precipitation into one of 11 possible hydrometeor classes in the form of a present weather code, with an associated indicator of uncertainty. To provide immediate feedback to data users, the observations are plotted in near-real time (NRT) and made publicly available on a website within 7 min. Here we describe the Disdrometer Verification Network and present specific cases from the first year of observations. Cases shown here suggest that the Thies LPM performs well at identifying transitions between rain and snow, but struggles with detection of graupel and pristine ice crystals (which occur infrequently in the United Kingdom) inherently, due to internal processing. The present weather code quality index is shown to have some skill without the supplementary sensors recommended by the manufacturer. Overall the Thies LPM is a useful tool for detecting hydrometeor type at the surface and DiVeN provides a novel dataset not previously observed for the United Kingdom.}},

The chemical transport model PMCAMx was extended to investigate the effects of partitioning and photochemical aging of biomass burning emissions on organic aerosol (OA) concentrations. A source-resolved version of the model, PMCAMx-SR, was developed in which biomass burning emissions and their oxidation products are represented separately from the other OA components. The volatility distribution and chemical aging of biomass burning OA (BBOA) were simulated based on recent laboratory measurements. PMCAMx-SR was applied to Europe during an early summer period (1–29 May 2008) and a winter period (25 February–22 March 2009). During the early summer, the contribution of biomass burning (both primary and secondary species) to total OA levels over continental Europe was estimated to be approximately 16 \%. During winter the contribution was nearly 47 \%, due to both extensive residential wood combustion but also wildfires in Portugal and Spain. The intermediate volatility compounds (IVOCs) with effective saturation concentration values of 105 and 106 µg m−3 are predicted to contribute around one third of the BBOA during the summer and 15 \% during the winter by forming secondary OA (SOA). The uncertain emissions of these compounds and their SOA formation potential require additional attention. Evaluation of PMCAMx-SR predictions against aerosol mass spectrometer measurements in several sites around Europe suggests reasonably good performance for OA (fractional bias less than 35 \% and fractional error less than 50 \%). The performance was weaker during the winter suggesting uncertainties in residential heating emissions and the simulation of the resulting BBOA in this season.}},

abstract = {{Abstract. We have identified a region of an ice cloud where a sharp transition of dual-wavelength ratio occurs at a fixed height for longer than 20 min. In this paper we provide evidence that rapid aggregation of ice particles occurred in this region, creating large particles. This evidence comes from triple-wavelength Doppler spectrum radar data that were fortuitously being collected. Through quantitative comparison of the Doppler spectra from the three radars we are able to estimate the ice particle size distribution (of particles larger than 0.75 mm) at different heights in the cloud. This allows us to investigate the evolution of the ice particle size distribution and determine whether the evolution is consistent with aggregation, riming or vapour deposition. The newly developed method allows us to isolate the signal from the larger (non-Rayleigh scattering) particles in the distribution. Therefore, a particle size distribution retrieval is possible in areas of the cloud where the dual-wavelength ratio method would fail because the bulk dual-wavelength ratio value is too close to zero. The ice particles grow rapidly from a maximum size of 0.75 to 5 mm while falling less than 500 m in under 10 min. This rapid growth is shown to agree well with theoretical estimates of aggregation, with aggregation efficiency being approximately 0.7, and is inconsistent with other growth processes, e.g. growth by vapour deposition or riming. The aggregation occurs in the middle of the cloud and is not present throughout the entire lifetime of the cloud. However, the layer of rapid aggregation is very well defined at a constant height, where the temperature is −15 ∘C and lasts for at least 20 min (approximate horizontal distance: 24 km). Immediately above this layer, the radar Doppler spectrum is bi-modal, which signals the formation of new small ice particles at that height. We suggest that these newly formed particles, at approximately −15 ∘C, grow dendritic arms, enabling them to easily interlock and accelerate the aggregation process. The large estimated aggregation efficiency in this cloud is consistent with recent laboratory studies for dendrites at this temperature.}},

abstract = {{Despite the fact that migratory insects dominate aerial bioflows in terms of diversity, abundance, and biomass [1–6], the migration patterns of most species, and the effects of their annual fluxes between high- and low-latitude regions, are poorly known. One important group of long-range migrants that remain understudied is a suite of highly beneficial species of hoverfly in the tribe Syrphini, which we collectively term “migrant hoverflies.” Adults are key pollinators [7–10] and larvae are significant biocontrol agents of aphid crop pests [11], and thus, it is important to quantify the scale of their migrations and the crucial ecosystem services they provide with respect to energy, nutrient, and biomass transport; regulation of crop pests; and pollen transfer. Such assessments cannot be made by sporadic observations of mass arrivals at ground level, because hoverflies largely migrate unnoticed high above ground. We used insect-monitoring radars [12] to show that up to 4 billion hoverflies (80 tons of biomass) travel high above southern Britain each year in seasonally adaptive directions. The long-range migrations redistribute tons of essential nutrients (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) and transport billions of pollen grains between Britain and Europe, and locally produced populations consume 6 trillion aphids and make billions of flower visits. Migrant hoverfly abundance fluctuated greatly between years, but there was no evidence of a population trend during the 10-year study period. Considering that many beneficial insects are seriously declining [7, 10, 13–19], our results demonstrate that migrant hoverflies are key to maintaining essential ecosystem services.}},

abstract = {{During the Convective Storm Initiation Project experiment, which was conducted in summer 2005 in southern England, vertical velocity in the convective boundary layer (CBL) was measured simultaneously with a research aircraft and a wind lidar. The aircraft performed horizontal flight legs approximately parallel to the prevailing wind direction and centred over the lidar. This measurement setup allows for the comparing of CBL characteristics (CBL depth, zi, integral length scale, lw, spectral peak wavelength, λm, vertical velocity variance, ) from temporal (lidar) and spatial (aircraft) measurements. For this, the lidar time series are transferred into space, using the mean wind. While the statistics of the aircraft data are all based on the 34-km flight legs, the averaging interval for the lidar is either 1 h or a longer period which corresponds to the 34 km leg. Although the lw and λm values from aircraft and lidar measurements are in the same range (100 – 200 m and 500 - 2000 m) and agree well on the average, the correlation for individual legs is very low (R2 < 0.17). One possible explanation is the large uncertainty which arises from the transfer of the lidar time series to space. For , the agreement between aircraft and lidar is better for individual legs (R2 ≥ 0.63), but the mean absolute difference in is about 2.5 times as large as the statistical error. We examine the nonstationarity and heterogeneity for the lidar and aircraft samples and can exclude these as the major sources for the large differences between lidar and aircraft data.}},
